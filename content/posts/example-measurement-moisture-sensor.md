To understand how the capacitive soil moisture sensor reacts to changes and to have basic idea how real values look like,
I ran an measurement of a small Basil plant. A measurement was taken approximately every second using a sensor labeled "Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor V1.2".

There are two sets of data, the first one was recorded for about 8 hours after watering the pretty drained soil.

The first column of the CSV file is a counter, the seconds column is the measured value. I watered at about counter value 80.

The second set of data was taken on the next day, without watering again:
